## Notes

Being the first Android project for all the contributing members the biggest challenge was to understand the differences between developing a Java program and an Android application. While it uses Java there are key differences in how it works, for example understanding the basic Android Activity lifecyles, Intents, different GUI elements, using AdapterViews, and implementing Google Firebase.
